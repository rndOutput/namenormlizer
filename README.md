# Name Normlizer

Created this to make normalizing file names faster.  Non-IT people love file names like "Really important MSWord.docx"   these names are less than optimal for use on a web sever.    

Type in or paste the text you want to change and toggle the checkboxes.  Still needs some clean-up and optimizing.
